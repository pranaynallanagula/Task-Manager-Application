# Task-Manager-Application

Project Overview:
The Task Manager application is designed to assist users in creating, assigning, and tracking tasks with deadlines and progress. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing tasks efficiently. The application consists of a front-end developed using Angular, a robust back-end built with Node.js, and MongoDB for task data storage.

Features:
The Task Manager application offers the following features:

User registration and authentication: Users can create accounts and log in securely to access the application.
Task creation and assignment: Users can create new tasks, assign them to themselves or other team members, and set deadlines.
Task tracking: Users can update the progress of tasks, mark them as completed, or reopen them if needed.
Task filtering and sorting: Users can filter and sort tasks based on various criteria, such as status, deadline, and assignee.
User profiles: Users have their own profiles where they can view and update their personal information.

Technologies Used
The Task Manager application was developed using the following technologies:

Angular: A popular front-end framework used to build the user interface and manage the application's components and state.
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used to build the back-end server, handle authentication, and provide API endpoints for seamless communication.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing task data and user information.
Postman: A powerful tool used for API testing during development to ensure smooth communication between the front-end and back-end.
Git: A version control system used to track changes, collaborate with team members, and manage the source code.


Getting Started
To run the Task Manager application locally, follow the steps below:

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager.git
Install the required dependencies for the front-end and back-end. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. Run the following commands in separate terminals:

# Install front-end dependencies
cd task-manager/front-end
npm install

# Install back-end dependencies
cd task-manager/back-end
npm install
Configure the application by updating the necessary configuration files. For example, you may need to set up the database connection in the back-end.

Start the front-end and back-end servers. Run the following commands in separate terminals:

# Start the front-end server
cd task-manager/front-end
ng serve

# Start the back-end server
cd task-manager/back-end
npm start
